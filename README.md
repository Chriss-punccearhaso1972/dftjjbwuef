Just walked out of Riff Raff. Okay, my brain's still buzzing like an old fridge, can't even make sense of it yet. The theater was so noisy, some dude a row behind was chewing popcorn like his life depended on it, it was like a background percussion to the whole thing. The movie — man, where do I start? This thing is like a fever dream cooked up by a raccoon on espresso. 

> There's this scene where the main guy, can't even remember his name, jumps into this river. But, more like political metaphors floatin' around like ducks, right? My back is killing me, those seats must've been engineered by sadists. And then, they had this surreal karaoke bit – you know, the one where they'd sing about sea turtles? Felt like watching a banana trying to have a philosophical argument with a stapler. My phone's buzzing non-stop, mom asking if she can download the movie later.

They kept cutting to these weird, almost vintage, scenes but with a modern twist, like steampunk meets IKEA. The lighting was...what's the word? Like if neon pink had a baby with a fog machine. My buddy said to watch the movie, but honestly, feels like more of an experience than a movie, ya know? Get lost in it and hope it spits you out whole on the other side.

> At one point, I think I saw a squirrel in the front row, just perched up there, probably more coherent than me right now. Felt like the movie was speaking a different language entirely, yet, sometimes, made more sense than reality. Someone left a sticky candy on my seat, and now I’m carrying part of the cinema wherever I go.

There's this wobbly logic to it — like a dream where you fly without wings but land wearing roller skates at a disco-themed funeral. I think I've lost what’s left of my sanity, but hey, who needs sanity when you can have Riff Raff? Better grab some coffee before I crash.
